As a sheet music program, [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/) is high-quality and sophisticated, but not modern as its several competitors,
such as [Verovio](https://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml) and [OSMD](https://opensheetmusicdisplay.org/).
For now, let's consider a good sheet music engine:
working with HTML5 facilitates animating features, and mobile devices are the best choice for music instruments assistance.
Yes, serving requests online is an option, but the service is inevitably expensive and slow.
