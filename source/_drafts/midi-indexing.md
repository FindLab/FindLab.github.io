## Motivation

Imagine you have a smart piano at home, which connected with a huge music staff library.
Once a time, you wanna play some muic opus on a whim, and it's so bothering that retrieve music staff in either category menus or a long favorite list,
so you just play by memory directly.
But the piano is so smart, just a few seconds later, it understands what you are playing, and displays the staff automatically.

Another scene. You see a nice piano when hangouting downtown, and you are just in a mood to play a music and show your ability to passers.
Surprisingly, the piano displays out the music information for what you are playing.
And when you finish, it says, well done! Your performence beat 95% players on this opus.

Imaginary scenes above are comming true. Now let's talk about some ideas for implementing a content based MIDI indexing and retrieving system.
